## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**Build Fails on Render**
- Ensure `build.sh` is executable (`chmod +x build.sh`)
- Check that all files are uploaded to GitHub
- Verify render.yaml configuration

**OCR Not Working**
- Confirm tesseract installation in build logs
- Check PDF is not password protected
- Ensure sufficient memory allocation

**Slow Processing**
- Large files take longer to process
- OCR processing is CPU intensive
- Consider upgrading to paid Render plan

**No Sections Found**
- Document may not contain standard mortgage sections
